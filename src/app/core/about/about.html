    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I am Dr. Sunil Job K. A., currently serving as the Director of Educational Research and Development at Marian College Kuttikkanam. With over three decades of experience in academic leadership and curriculum innovation, my journey has been deeply rooted in Outcome-Based Education (OBE), Bloom’s Taxonomy, and the evolving landscape of AI-integrated teaching-learning ecosystems.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mission is to empower institutions to adopt learner-centric models grounded in NEP 2020, where measurable learning outcomes, critical thinking, and industry-relevant skills are at the core of education. I design frameworks, train faculty, and implement digital platforms that blend academic rigor, technology-enhanced pedagogy, and data-driven decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through national-level training sessions, AI-powered tools like Teacher.AI, and strategic curriculum design, I contribute to shaping institutions that not only meet accreditation benchmarks but also produce future-ready graduates.
